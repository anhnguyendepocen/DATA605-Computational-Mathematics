## Question 1. 

Use integration by substitution to solve the integral below:

$\int4e^{-7x} dx$


\[
=\int4e^{-7x} dx\\ 
= 4\int e^{-7x}dx\\
Substitute \ u = -7x,  \ \  du=-7 dx \rightarrow dx=-\frac{1}{7}du\\
=-\frac{4}{7}\int e^udu\\
=-\frac{4e^u}{7} + C
\]


## Question 2. 

Biologists are treating a pond contaminated with bacteria.  The level of contamination is changing at a rate of $\frac{dN}{dt} = -\frac{3150}{t^4}-220$ bacteria per cubic centimeter per day, where t is the number of days since treatment began.  Find a function $N(t)$ to estimate the level of contamination if the level after 1 day was 6530 bacteria per cubic centimeter.

The function $N(t)$ can be derived by taking the integral of the changing rate:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\int \frac{dN}{dt} &= \int -\frac{3150}{t^4}-220 \ dt\\
&= -3150\int \frac{1}{t^4} - 220 \ dt\\
&= -3150 \int t^{-4} -220 \ dt\\
&= -3150 \frac{t^{-3}}{-3} - 220t + C\\
&= 1050 t^{-3} - 220t + C
\end{aligned}
\]

Estimate level of contamination for $6530 = N(1)$
\[
\begin{aligned}
6530 = \frac{1050}{1^3} - 220(1) + C\\
6530 - 830 = C\\
5700 = C
\end{aligned}
\]


## Question 3.

Find the total area of the red rectangles in the figure below, where the equation of the line is  $f(x) = 2x - 9$

![](C:/Users/javer/Documents/DATA605/Discussion13.png)

From the looks of the graph, the upper bound would be `8.5` and the lower bound `4.5`. Each rectangle has a width of `1` $\rightarrow (8.5 - 4.5) / 4 = 1$. 

Since the area of a rectangle is $height \times width$ then the solution goes as follows:

Rectangle 1: $1 \times 1 = 1$

Rectangle 2: $3 \times 1 = 3$

Rectangle 3: $5 \times 1 = 5$

Rectangle 4: $7 \times 1 = 7$

Sum up the areas: $1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16$

Using R....

```{r}
rec <- function(x) {2*x - 9}
integrate(rec, lower = 4.5, upper = 8.5)

```



## Question 4.

Find the area of the region bounded by the graphs of the given equations:

$y = x^2 - 2x - 2, \ \  y= x + 2$

```{r}
curve(x^2-2*x-2, -3, 5, col = "red")
curve(x+2, add = TRUE, col = "blue")

```

Based on the graph we can see that two curves intersect at `-1` and `4` which will be the lower and upper bounds respectively. Larger (left) function seems to be <span style="color:blue">blue </span> with $x + 2$ and the smaller (right) function is <span style="color:red">red </span> with $x^2 - 2x - 2$. To find the area we'll minus the `smaller function` from the `larger function` then integrate: 

\[
\int_{-1}^{4} (x+2) - (x^2 - 2x - 2)\\
=\int_{-1}^{4} -x^2 + 3x + 4\\
\]

Using R to to find the area:


```{r}
f <- function(x) {-x^2 + 3*x + 4}
integrate(f, lower = -1, upper = 4)

```




## Question 5.

A beauty supply store expects to sell 110 flat irons during the next year.  It costs \$3.75 to store one flat iron for one year.  There is a fixed cost of \$8.25 for each order.  Find the lot size and the number of orders per year that will minimize inventory costs.

Breakdown:

Fixed cost is $8.75 \times (110 / x) = 907.5/x$

Let us assume one third of their items remain at the end of the year. Storage cost is $3.75 \times \frac{x}{3} = 1.25x$

Cost = $Fixed \ cost + Storage \ cost = 907.5/x + \frac{3.75x}{3}$


```{r}
cost <-expression((907.5 / x) + 1.25*x)
D(cost, 'x')
```
$1.255 - 907.5/x^2$

Solve for $1.25 - 907.5/x^2= 0$

\[
\begin{aligned}
1.25 = \frac{907.5}{x^2}\\
1.25x^2 = 907.5\\
x^2 = \frac{907.5}{1.25}\\
x^2 = 726\\
x = \sqrt{726}\\
x = 26.94439\\\\
\therefore Lot  \ Size = 27  \ and  \\\ Number \ of \ Orders = 4.1
\end{aligned}
\]





## Question 6.

Use integration by parts to solve the integral below.

$\int ln(9x). x^6dx$

\[
u = ln(9x) \qquad v= \frac{x^7}{7}\\
du= \frac{1}{x} \qquad dv= x^6\\
\]

Using the method
\[
\begin{aligned}
\int u \ dv &= uv-\int v \ du\\
&=\frac{ln(9x)x^7}{7} - \int \frac{x^7}{7}. \frac{1}{x} \ dx\\
&= \frac{ln(9x)x^7}{7} - \int \frac{x^6}{7} dx\\
&= \frac{ln(9x)x^7}{7} - \frac{1}{7} \int x^6 dx\\
&= \frac{ln(9x)x^7}{7} - \frac{1}{7}.\frac{x^7}{7}\\
&= \frac{ln(9x)x^7}{7} - \frac{x^7}{49}\\
&= x^7\left(\frac{1}{7}ln(9x) - \frac{1}{49}\right) + C
\end{aligned}
\]


## Question 7.

Determine whether $f(x)$ is a probability density function on the interval $[1, e^6]$.  If not, determine the value of the definite integral. 

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{6x}$$

\[
\int\ \frac{1}{6x} \ dx\\
\frac{1}{6} \int \frac{1}{x} \ dx\\
\frac{1}{6}.ln(x) \ + C
\]



Evaluating ...

$$\frac{1}{6}.ln(e^6) - \frac{1}{6}.ln(1) = 1-0 = 1$$


So it is a probability density function since it satisfies the condition where $\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f(x) \ dx = 1$
