## Choose independently two numbers B and C at random from the interval [0, 1] with uniform density. Prove that B and C are proper probability distributions.   Note that the point (B,C) is then chosen at random in the unit square. 


```{r}
set.seed(123)
B <- runif(10000, 0, 1)
C <- runif(10000, 0, 1)
```

## Find the probability that: 

### (a) $B + C < 1/2$

```{r}
X <- B + C
sum(X < 1/2)/10000
```


### (b) $BC < 1/2$

```{r}
X <- B * C
sum(X < 1/2)/10000

```



### (c) $|B âˆ’ C| < 1/2$

```{r}
X <- abs(B - C)
sum(X < 1/2)/10000

```



### (d) $max\{B,C\} < 1/2$


```{r}
sum(pmax(B, C) < 1/2) / 10000

```



### (e) $min\{B,C\} < 1/2$

```{r}
sum(pmin(B, C) < 1/2) / 10000

```
